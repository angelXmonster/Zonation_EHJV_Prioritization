# **Zonation_EHJV_Prioritization**

## Steps

Step 0.1. Download/Install Zonation 5 

Step 0.2. If you don't know how to use Zonation, you can find a step-by-step of the basics on how to make a prioritization using the Zonation GUI [here](https://github.com/angelXmonster/Zonation_EHJV_Prioritization/tree/main/Step0_1).

	Step 1. Create the settings file
	Here is the list of the setting that are going to be used.  

	Step 2. Create the features file
	Here are the density raster files of each species and the weights you are including.

	Step 3. Run the prioritization
  
Step 1. Data preparation. 

All data preparation was done on R.  

Here rasters are going to be clipped in the desiared study area and a feature file is going to be created with the proper weights. 
"How to prioritization.RMD" documents how data preparation for the EHJV prioritization was done. So that document can be follow to prepare BAM national models for other zonation prioritization.
