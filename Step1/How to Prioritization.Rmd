```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This markdown is created to document step by step the EHJV prioritization. 

1. First I created the function [ClipMaps] [pkg::func()], which clip any raster based on a shapefile containing the study area. 
This function can clip rastets individually or it can be feed with the whole folder where are stored the rasters to be clipped.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
